I am an innovative native android developer. I write codes in Java, Kotlin and C++.
I have had the opportunity to work with several clients and developers with a wide range of skill sets as a freelancer on Upwork, Fiver and several freelancing sites.
This is personally rewarding and I have honed and fine tuned my skils to be better in native android development
